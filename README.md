  ***
 The code for this project was researched extensively. Here are a few of the tutorials I found helpful:

   - [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/3457)     
    
      ```test('name', () => {
        expect({value: 'value'}).toBeTruthy();
        expect(typeof {value: 'value'}).toBe('object');
        })
      ```

  - [jest](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50818474/how-to-properly-test-if-the-type-of-the-result-is-a-javascript-function-in-jes) 

    ```describe("", () => {
      it("test", () => {
      const somethingThatReturnsAFunction = () => () => {};
      const theResult = somethingThatReturnsAFunction();
      expect(typeof theResult).toBe("function");
      });
     ```

    ```Say we want two arrays now: one for rebel pilots, the other one for imperials. With .filter() it couldn’t be easier!```

    ```The syntax for expression interpolation is ${}. Anything we place between the curly brackets will be executed as code. In here we can pass variables, functions, or other logic that will be evaluated and it’s final value displayed.```

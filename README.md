  ## Credits 
  This project is created with the following technologies:
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
  - [Inquirer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) 
  ***
 The code for this project was researched extensively. Here are a few of the tutorials I found helpful:

   - [The “+=” operator](https://digifisk.com/front-end-web-development/javascript/concatenate-two-strings-in-javascript)

      ```Just like the “+” operator, the “+=” operator can be used for concatenation as well. If used with numbers, it’ll add the numbers and assign it to the variable at the left-hand side of the operator. But when used with one or more strings, it’ll automatically transform into yet another string concatenation operator and concatenate the two operands, even if one of them is a number.```

    ```This is from stackoverflow: Omitting the second expression when using the if-else shorthand. user: ajax333221```

  - [Template Literals and String interpolation](https://dmitripavlutin.com/string-interpolation-in-javascript/) 

    ```String interpolation is a process where you can pass a valid JavaScript expression such as a variable into a template literal. The expression inside ${} is evaluated, and the result of the evaluation is embedded into the string.  ```

  - [Additional examples on Template Literals and expression interpolation](https://ado.xyz/blog/better-strings-in-javascript-with-template-literals/) 

    ```The syntax for expression interpolation is ${}. Anything we place between the curly brackets will be executed as code. In here we can pass variables, functions, or other logic that will be evaluated and it’s final value displayed.  ```
